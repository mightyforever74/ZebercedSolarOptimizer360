- 📐 Universal solar panel catalog (dimensions, power, weight, efficiency)
- 🌇 Obstacle-aware layout (chimneys, shading zones, etc.)
- ⚡ Electricity need calculation & panel matching
- 🧱 Weight limit filtering for structural safety
- 💰 Cost vs. Efficiency comparison (ROI-based selection)
- 🖼️ 2D visual panel layout (coming soon)
- 📄 PDF/HTML customer-friendly proposal generation
